# Senior Project Game
A game created during my last semester of high school to showcase the process of planning and creating a game.
The game will be a side-scrolling platformer with simple 1-bit style graphics.
I have drawn inspiration from Super Castlevania IV and Hollow Knight mainly.
## Running
The Rust program is intended to be built and run with Cargo in the top directory.
At this point the program should be cross-platform, but it was built in Arch Linux.
